= Replicate

Simple Postgres replication for Rails. Replicates specific columns from one table to
another using auto-generated triggers. Just add simple directives in your migrations.

== Usage:

  ActiveRecord::Migration.extend(Replicate)

  class AddReplication < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      replicate :names,
        :to     => :users,
        :fields => [:first_name, :last_name]

      replicate :data,
        :to     => :users,
        :fields => [:eye_color, :height]
        :key    => 'user_id',
        :prefix => 'data'

      replicate :events,
        :to         => :users,
        :fields     => {:start_year => :year},
        :key        => 'user_id',
        :prefix     => 'ROW.type',
        :prefix_map => {'BirthEvent' => 'birth', 'GraduationEvent' => 'grad'}

      replicate :locations,
        :to         => :users,
        :fields     => [:latitude, :longitude, {[:city, :state, :country] => :location}],
        :through    => 'SELECT * FROM events WHERE address_id = ROW.id',
        :key        => 'user_id',
        :prefix     => 'THROUGH.type',
        :prefix_map => {'BirthEvent' => 'birth', 'GraduationEvent' => 'grad'}
    end
  end
 
There are a lot of options. The code is mostly self explanatory, but I will document it
more on request or when I get some more time.
